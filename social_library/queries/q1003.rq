#title:For each pet species get the number of pets and their average weight
#comment:the graph pattern matching process generates the possible solutions as a list of ?species, ?pet and ?weight values tuples
#comment:then for each ?species value (grouping criterion), the ?pet values are counted and the average ?weight is calculated
#comment:with the aggregate functions COUNT() and AVG()
#tags:exercise,3 graph patterns,3 variables,GROUP BY,aggregate function COUNT(),aggregate function AVG()

select ?species (COUNT(?pet) as ?petCount) (AVG(?weight) as ?avgWeight) where {
  ?species rdfs:subClassOf tto:Animal .
  ?pet rdf:type ?species .
  ?pet tto:weight ?weight .
}
GROUP BY ?species
