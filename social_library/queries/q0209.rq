# In this scenario we only have 2 persons who have pets, so it is not the best example
# but you could see the potential of union in a real scenario, where we would have many owners and we would 
# like to filter just a few of them
#
# Alternatively you can also use the keyword VALUES that sets what the values of ?owner could be (faster option)
#
# select ?owner ?pet where {
#	VALUES (?owner) { (ttr:William) (ttr:John) }
#	?owner tto:pet ?pet .
#}
