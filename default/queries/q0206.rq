#title:Select persons and their pets
#comment:From now one let's assume that "select persons" means "select things that are persons" by selecting subjects connected to the object dbo:Person via the predicate rdf:type.
#comment:In this case we also want the ?person to be connected to an object ?pet via the predicate tto:pet
#comment:?person and ?pet are the 2 variables
#tags:1 graph pattern,2 variables,2 conditions
#color:ex-blue
#img:cartoon-rdf-type

select ?person ?pet where {
    ?person rdf:type dbo:Person .
	?person tto:pet ?pet .
}

# another example where we select 2 variables
#
# notice that only the persons 
#
#Â who actually have a pet are returned in the result set
